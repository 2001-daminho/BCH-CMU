            <h3>Brief History of the Department</h3>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              The Department of Biochemistry of Chrisland University, Abeokuta, (Nigeria) is one of the academic Departments created in the College of Natural and Applied Sciences at the inception of the University in 2015/2016 academic session. It was established as a unit under the forerunner Department of Chemical Sciences, College of Natural and Applied Sciences of which Dr. O.M. Bolaji (Ph.D.) became the pioneer Head of Department in an Acting position, from 2016 to 2018. At inception the Department had only three (3) registered students. On August 15, 2018, a Chair of Biochemistry was created and Professor Emmanuel N. Maduagwu (FAS) became its first appointee and occupant. Over the years, the Department has grown by leaps and bounds and has graduated many students who are doing very well in academia, industries, research institutes and all other areas of scientific endeavors. The University graduated her 5th sets of students recently and our students from Biochemistry Department were part of this convocation ceremony. The Department currently has Professor E. Olatunde Farombi, FAS, FNSBMB, as the Head of Department.

              Omolaja Osoniyi, B.Sc. (Lagos), M.Sc., PhD. (Ife) is a Professor of Biochemistry at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife since October 1, 2020 and currently on sabbatical at Chrisland University, Abeokuta. A researcher and teacher of biochemistry for almost three decades to biochemistry majors and others in the life sciences, he strives to simplify concepts for his students with examples from everyday life, thus inspiring them to engage more with the discipline. His research spans; rationalizing the ethnomedicinal use of indigenous plants, food security and maintenance of health through the diet, new chemotherapeutic agents for cancer and novel bioactive principles from edible marine molluscs.
              He is a member of various professional bodies including Nigerian Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (NSBMB), American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and International Natural Product Sciences Taskforce (INPST).
